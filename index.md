My name is **Pablo**, and I am an **Embedded Systems Engineer** living in *Virginia Beach, VA (USA)*.

I love [writing firmware for embedded devices and designing electronic circuits](/embedded/), as well as helping others implement or outsource their electronics design process. I speak English and Spanish.

**I love making stuff**. In 2015, a friend and I opened **FÃ¡brica Digital** makerspace in our hometown to spread our passion for the [*maker culture* (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maker_culture). A place to learn and enjoy electronics, programming and 3D printing, while helping other makers with their projects and nurturing the maker community in our area.

I am also the IT guy in a family of four.
