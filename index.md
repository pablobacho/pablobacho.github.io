My name is **Pablo**, and I am an **Embedded Systems Engineer** living in [*Cádiz, Spain* (Google Maps)](https://goo.gl/maps/5E74DaQcQxSe71aZ9).

I do [freelance work](/embedded/) designing electronics and developing firmware for embedded systems, as well as consulting helping companies implement or outsource their electronics design process. I speak English and Spanish.

**I love making stuff**. In 2015, a friend and I opened **Fábrica Digital** makerspace in our hometown to spread our passion for the [*maker culture* (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maker_culture). A place to learn and enjoy electronics, programming and 3D printing, while helping other makers with their projects and nurturing the maker community in our area.

I am also the IT guy in a family of four.
