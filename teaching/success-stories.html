    <p>I love showing off my students’ achievements! These are some of them:</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="blanca-xian">Blanca Xian</h3>

<p>Blanca started learning Arduino in 2016, in a group class with elementary school kids at Fábrica Digital makerspace when she was in 4th grade. She was progressing so fast that the year after she joined a group with middle-school students, joining my group one year after, with the adults, while she was just in 6th grade.</p>

<p>Blanca has finished two projects. A 100% 3D printed robotic car powered by Arduino and controlled with an app, and a weather station also 3D printed and Arduino-powered.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blancaxian_showcase.jpg" alt="Photos of Blanca Xian and her projects" /></p>

<p>Blanca is starting middle school in 2019 and she already got a project portfolio that sure will be praised by her teachers at the new school.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="pablo-garcía-jaén">Pablo García Jaén</h3>

<p>Pablo was my very first student at Fábrica Digital makerspace. He started learning Arduino, becoming fluent in programming in just a few months. He does not hesitate taking on extremely ambitious projects, and you can tell the great amount of time that he spends working on them when you see the results. Pablo can program on Arduino very fluently, he is capable of designing in 3D complex mechanic systems, build mobile apps and even design and make his own electronic circuit boards.</p>

<p>His project Moais’Pider, a robotic spider powered by Arduino that he could control using a mobile app and some sensing gloves that he built himself, was awarded a 2nd prize in the regional contest “Feria Andaluza de Tecnología 2016”. He has been featured on different newspapers and has been a lecturer at Arduino Day at University of Cadiz. All of this at the age of 16. His project STEVE (Artilithecus Ramidus), a robot capable of feeling touch, was awarded a Bifrutas grant competing at national level.</p>

<p><img src="/images/pablogarciajaen_showcase.jpg" alt="Photos of Pablo García Jaén and his projects" /></p>

<p>In highschool Pablo experienced how useful learning 3D design on FreeCAD is, making his asignments of technical drawing much easier because of tools that he already knew. He was also chosen to participate at Jerez Science Fair 2016 by his school.</p>

<p>Today (2020), Pablo is an undergrad at University of Sevilla, pursuing studies of Electronics, Robotics and Mechatronics Engineering. He has not stopped tinkering and inventing things. His current project, QBots, is a set of robots that autonomously are capable of coordinate and position themselves to make different shapes. He was very protective of his ideas at the beginning, but he learn the benefits of sharing, documenting his work and make it accessible to others. Today he is proud of having a 4-year portfolio of projects that he can use to showcase his skills when applying for scholarships and programs he is competing with other students on.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="miguel-azores">Miguel Azores</h3>

<p>Miguel attended his first workshop with me in September 2015, to join us permanently on Christmas. Like most of my students, he started learning Arduino, using it to build a scale model house equipped with all kinds of sensors, automation and alarms. He got interviewed by the local TV about his project when he was showing it off at Jerez Science Fair 2016.</p>

<p><img src="/images/teaching_success_stories_miguelazores.jpg" alt="Photo of Miguel Azores being interviewed by the local TV channel" /></p>

<p>During his senior year in highschool, he helped building the 3D printer of his school. He also leveraged his skills on 3D design on FreeCAD for a class assignment that got praised by his teacher.</p>

<p>Today (2020), Miguel is an undergrad at University Rey Juan Carlos in Madrid, studying Software Robotics Engineering, where he has as a teacher Juan Gonzalez -Obijuan-, the first Spanish person winning the most important opensource award in the world. He signs up for all the activities, workshops and trainings he is able at school. Learning Arduino programming at an early age made learning Python and Micro:Bit easier in college, and Miguel points out how from the very beginning he has been following the good programming practices he learnt with me regarding clean code and comments. He is on a big advantage compared to the rest of his classmates.</p>

<h3 id="marcos-lope">Marcos Lope</h3>

<p>Marcos joined my class in January 2016 when he was 15, a really good age to learn programming using a prototyping platform like Arduino. At that age they are capable of taking on relatively complex projects that keeps them engaged. Soon he started using the 3D printer and designing his own parts using OpenSCAD.</p>

<p>In the year and a half that he was my student for, his most ambitious project was a GoPro camera-equipped robot that he controlled from his phone. To make it he had to learn about Bluetooth and Android app development. His robot moves using a chain system designed and 3D printed by himself, and he also had to learn about the robot’s mechanics.</p>

<p><img src="/images/teaching_success_stories_marcoslope.jpg" alt="Photo of Marcos Lope's project" /></p>

<p>Today (2020), Marcos is an undergrad studying Construction Engineering at University of Sevilla, at the same school that hosts Sevilla Fablab, a digital fabrication lab equipped with 3D printers, laser cutting machines and CNC. At college he uses tools such as AutoCAD and Revit, and he told me how his classmates and teachers point out his ability working on a 3D plane. All those hours that Marcos spent learning 3D design on OpenSCAD definitely paid off.</p>
