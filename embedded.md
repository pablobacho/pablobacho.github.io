My name is Pablo, and I help businesses build solutions based on embedded systems.

As an electronics engineer and an embedded systems specialist I can help you design, validate, develop, prototype and manufacture your product:

* Meetings with your team in the early stages of **conceptualization** of a new product, providing my experience on electronics design, test and manufacturing.
* Helping to choose the best key components –**Bill-of-Materials (BOM)**– for your application.
* **Designing** your electronics and electrical circuits.
* **Developing firmware** for your embedded system.
* **Prototyping the electronic circuits** for your product.
* Helping to set up an **electronics manufacturing** plan.
* As a reviewer in every stage of the process: **BOM, design and code review**.

I can help you in every step of your project, or I can support specific stages of development of your product.
