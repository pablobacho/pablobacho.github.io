I am always learning a lot from others and I love teaching as a way of helping back.

I have been teaching at:

### MWR Rota Community Classes

In 2018 I started a *Robotics, Programming and 3D Printing* program at Naval Station Rota, Spain. My students were U.S. military families (elementary and middle-school age) as well as active-duty members of the U.S. Navy.

### Universidad de Cádiz

I have been invited from 2016 to 2018 as a guest lecturer at the local university in Cádiz, Spain, to teach about embedded systems and entrepreneurship at undergraduate and postgraduate levels. Also as a guest speaker for extra-curricular events.

### Fábrica Digital

I started a business in my hometown in 2015 where I have been teaching programming, electronics and 3D printing. Among my students I had teenage kids, grown-up hobbyists, trade-school and college students, school teachers, and professionals.
